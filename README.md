This is a recipe site.

I started with the index.html file
I then made a new directory for holding the recipe pages
I constructed the individual files for the recipes
I linked photos of the dishes into each of the recipe files. 
I should Probably make a separate directory within the Odin-recipes directory
In the recipe files, I used ordered and unordered list tags as well as headings, paragraphs, and images.
I used headings, anchor tags, and an unordered list
