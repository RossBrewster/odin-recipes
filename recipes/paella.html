            <li>Onion (1 medium, finely chopped)</li>
            <li>Bell pepper (1 medium, diced)</li>
            <li>Garlic cloves (3-4 cloves, minced)</li>
            <li>Tomato (1 medium, diced)</li>
            <li>Chicken broth (4 cups or 950 ml)</li>
            <li>Saffron threads (1/2 teaspoon)</li>
            <li>Smoked paprika (1 teaspoon)</li>
            <li>Olive oil (2 tablespoons)</li>
            <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
            <li>Black pepper (to taste)</li>
            <li>Lemon wedges (for serving)</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley (chopped, for garnish)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large paella pan or a wide, shallow skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chicken pieces and chorizo sausage slices. Cook until the chicken is browned on all sides and the chorizo is slightly crispy. Remove them from the pan and set aside.</li>

            <li>In the same pan, add the diced onion and bell pepper. Saut√© until they become soft and translucent. Then, add the minced garlic and diced tomato. Continue cooking for a few more minutes until the tomatoes start to break down.</li>

            <li>Add the rice to the pan and stir well to coat it with the onion, pepper, and tomato mixture. Toast the rice for a couple of minutes until it becomes slightly translucent.</li>

            <li>Meanwhile, in a separate pot, heat the chicken broth until it reaches a simmer. Crush the saffron threads between your fingers and add them to the broth, stirring to infuse the flavor and color.</li>

            <li>Pour the saffron-infused chicken broth into the paella pan with the rice. Sprinkle the smoked paprika evenly over the rice. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Give it a gentle stir to distribute the ingredients evenly in the pan.</li>

            <li>Place the chicken and chorizo back into the pan, nestling them into the rice. Arrange the shrimp and mussels or clams on top, pressing them slightly into the rice.</li>

            <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan with a lid or aluminum foil, and let the paella simmer for about 20-25 minutes. Avoid stirring the paella during this time, as it develops a crust on the bottom called the "socarrat."</li>

            <li>After 20-25 minutes, check if the rice is cooked and the seafood is cooked through and opened (for mussels or clams). If the rice is not cooked yet, cover and continue cooking for a few more minutes.</li>
            
            <li>Once the rice is cooked and the seafood is done, remove the paella from the heat and let it rest, covered, for about 5 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld together and the socarrat to develop.</li>

            <li>Garnish the paella with freshly chopped parsley and serve it directly from the pan. Offer lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over the paella to add a bright citrus flavor.</li>
        </ol>
