</div>   
     <h2 class="header">Ingredients</h2>
        <div class="list">
            <ul class="items">
                <li>Elbow macaroni or other pasta shapes (2 cups or 200 grams)</li>
                <li>Cheddar cheese (shredded, 2 cups or 200 grams)</li>
                <li>Milk (2 cups or 480 ml)</li>
                <li>Unsalted butter (4 tablespoons or 56 grams)</li>
                <li>All-purpose flour (1/4 cup or 30 grams)</li>
                <li>Mustard powder (1/2 teaspoon)</li>
                <li>Salt (1/2 teaspoon, or to taste)</li>
                <li>Black pepper (1/4 teaspoon, or to taste)</li>
                <li>Optional: additional cheese for topping or breadcrumbs for a crispy topping</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    <h2 class="header">Instructions</h2>
        <div class="ordered-list">
            <ol class="steps">
                <li>Cook the macaroni pasta according to the package instructions, until it is al dente (firm but not overly soft). Drain the pasta and set it aside.</li>

                <li>In a large saucepan or pot, melt the unsalted butter over medium heat. Once melted, add the flour to the pot and whisk continuously to form a roux. Cook the roux for about 1-2 minutes until it turns slightly golden in color.</li>

                <li>Slowly pour in the milk while whisking constantly to incorporate it into the roux. Continue whisking until the mixture thickens and comes to a gentle simmer. This creates the base for the cheese sauce.</li>

                <li>Reduce the heat to low. Add the shredded cheddar cheese to the sauce, reserving a small portion for topping if desired. Stir the sauce gently until the cheese is completely melted and smooth.</li>

                <li>Add the mustard powder, salt, and black pepper to the cheese sauce, and stir well to combine. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasonings according to your preference.</li>

                <li>Add the cooked macaroni pasta to the cheese sauce, stirring until all the pasta is coated evenly. Ensure that the sauce coats the pasta thoroughly for a creamy and delicious result.</li>

                <li>If you prefer a baked mac and cheese with a crispy topping, transfer the mixture to a greased baking dish. Sprinkle the reserved shredded cheese or breadcrumbs over the top.</li>

                <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly. Skip this step if you prefer stovetop mac and cheese.</li>

                <li>Once cooked, remove the macaroni and cheese from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. This will allow the sauce to thicken slightly before serving.</li>

                <li>Serve the macaroni and cheese hot as a comforting main dish or a side dish. It pairs well with a fresh salad or steamed vegetables. Enjoy your delicious homemade mac and cheese!</li>
