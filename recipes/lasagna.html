        <div class="ordered-list">
            <ol class="steps">
                <li>Preheat your oven to the temperature specified on the lasagna noodle package.</li>
                
                <li>In a large skillet or frying pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and saut√© until they become translucent and fragrant.</li>

                <li>Add the ground beef or Italian sausage to the pan. Break it up with a spoon or spatula and cook until it's browned and cooked through. Make sure to drain any excess fat if necessary.</li>

                <li>Add the tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using) to the pan. Stir well to combine all the ingredients. Let the sauce simmer for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Adjust the seasonings according to your taste.</li>

                <li>While the sauce is simmering, cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. If using regular noodles, cook them until they are al dente (firm but not overly soft). If using oven-ready noodles, follow the package instructions for layering directly in the baking dish.</li>

                <li>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese and grated Parmesan cheese. Mix well until smooth and well combined.</li>

                <li>Once the sauce is ready and the noodles are cooked, it's time to assemble the lasagna. Begin by spreading a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a greased baking dish. This will prevent the noodles from sticking to the dish.</li>

                <li>Place a layer of lasagna noodles on top of the sauce, covering the entire bottom of the dish. Spread a generous layer of the meat sauce over the noodles, followed by dollops of the ricotta cheese mixture. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the ricotta layer.</li>

                <li>Repeat the layering process until all the ingredients are used, ending with a layer of meat sauce and a generous sprinkle of shredded mozzarella cheese on top.</li>

                <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, until the cheese is melted and golden brown.</li>

                <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley, if desired.</li>
